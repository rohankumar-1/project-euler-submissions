# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


## Answer

The even terms are every third term starting with 2, since given odd+odd = even, and even+odd=odd, we have the following pattern:

1 - odd
2 - even
3 - odd = even + odd
5 - odd = even + odd
8 - even = odd + odd
13 - odd = odd + even
...

And so on. This pattern basically shows us that every third term is even

We can solve this with simple python code (with tabulation)
